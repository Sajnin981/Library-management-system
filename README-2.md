# 📚 Library Management System – C# Console App

This is a simple **console-based library management system** written in **C#**. It allows users to add, delete, and update book records while demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like **classes**, **encapsulation**, **constructors**, and **getters/setters**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📖 Add a book (Title, Author, Year Published)
- ❌ Delete a book by title
- 🔄 Update a book's year of publication
- 📊 View total number of books
- ⌨️ Menu-driven console interaction

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ **Encapsulation**: All book properties are private with controlled access.
- 🏗️ **Constructors**: Used to initialize book data on creation.
- 🔐 **Getter & Setter Properties**:
  - `Title` and `Author` are **get-only** properties.
  - `YearPublished` is a **set-only** property (demonstrating partial access).
- 📋 **List<Book>**: Used to store book records dynamically.
